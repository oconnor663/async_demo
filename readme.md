- regular program calling foo() and bar() in series
- use threads to make it parallel
  - first with std::thread::spawn, then with rayon::join
- Tokio version using join
  - using std::thread::sleep ruins the concurrency
  - this is how we know it was running on one thread before
- write our own join
  - do it wrong with two loops
- write our own sleep
  - doesn't work, because it doesn't wake
- use threads to wake it
- rewrite the event loop to busy wait
  - follow the execution line-by-line
- use a thread_local
- follow-up topics
  - tasks and the Context parameter
  - Pin
  - real IO
